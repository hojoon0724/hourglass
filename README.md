# Project Hourglass

### Summary

Project Hourglass is a countdown time-tracking app that lets professionals working on an hourly billing basis (such as consultants, lawyers, tutors, freelancers, and contractors) to easily monitor the remaining time allocated to their clients or projects.

### Implementation Details

#### Origin:

This project began as a programming immersive course's capstone project that required self-learning a new programming language.

#### Choice of Swift:

Swift was chosen for its compatibility with the Apple ecosystem, as I intend to extend it to other Apple devices.

#### UIKit and Xcode:

In conjunction with Swift, the project will utilize UIKit and Xcode for building the application's user interface and development environment.

#### MVP Focus:

The primary focus for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to implement full CRUD functionality, enabling users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data within the application.
